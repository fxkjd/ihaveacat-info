# Introduction

List of interesting Posts/Notes/Tools/Resources in general I found in the wild.

This list is for anyone wishing to learn about CS but it is specially focused in IT Security.

This info will be updated regularly with resources and notes that I find.

Anyway, you can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/fxkjd/ihaveacat-info/pulls) to add more information.
